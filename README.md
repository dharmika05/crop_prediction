🌾 Crop Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts the most suitable crop to cultivate based on environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, soil pH, and rainfall using a machine learning model. It aims to assist farmers in making informed agricultural decisions.

🚀 Project Overview

Efficient crop selection is essential for maximizing yield and sustainability. This system uses a Random Forest Classifier trained on historical data to accurately recommend the most appropriate crop for the given environmental conditions.
